			<p class="intro">As a technology which can assist precise treatment, remote patient monitoring, edlerly health monitoring and so on, so as to reduce the medical burden and benefit long-term care, smart health care through mobile sensing has always drawn enormous attention. Such a trend  will increase dramatically, since the number of people aged 65 or older becomes more and more in the near future in many coutries.  The evolution of smart health care through mobile sensing has also experienced a number of challenges including, usersâ€™ security and privacy problem, applicability in real scenario, communication among various devices, hertergenous data management  and accurate pridiction, poor scalability, and etc. Various theories, prediction models and sophisticated mechanisms have been proposed to deal with the problems of the smart health care. The recent advances in mobile sensing technoliges, Internet of Things (IoT),  and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have brought new opportunities in overcoming the challenges of  health care. However, towards mobile sensing with more secure, more real-time, more scalable, more applicable and more accurate smart health care, we still have a long way to go.
			</p>
			<p class="intro">We believe that future mobile sensing will closely fuse with 5th Generation (5G) and Beyond-5G technologies, comprehensive fusion between crowd sourcing, AI, and thrustworty mobile sensing. Thus, the future mobile sensing also need to solve a lot of emerging research issues, such as the privacy and security of user data, behavior monitoring based on hertergenous data, precise prediction, real-time mechanisms, and etc. Once the smart health care technology becomes more intelligent, more secure, more real-time, more scalable, more applicable and more accurate in the future, it will spark more blue-sky thinking, and innovative ideas that can improve the future mobile sensing technologies to another level with strong application guarantee.
			</p>
			<p class="intro">Thereby, the goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and experts from academia and industry to discuss and promote the research and development needed to overcome the major challenges that pertain to this research direction with strong application potential. The scope of this workshop includes but not limited to the following topics.
			</p>

			<p class="intro">The workshop will feature two keynote speeches given by world leading researchers in the field. The workshop accepts only original and previously unpublished papers. All submissions must be formatted in standard ACM conference proceedings format (two-column, 10pt format). The maximum number of printed pages is six including figures. Papers must include the author names and affiliations for single-blind peer reviewing by the program committee. Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their papers at the workshop. Accepted papers will be published in the ACM mmNets proceedings and will be archived in the ACM Digital Library.
